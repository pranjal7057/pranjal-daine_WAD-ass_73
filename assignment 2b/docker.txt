Docker 
An open-source platform called Docker enables you to automate the distribution and 
administration of applications inside of software containers. It offers a method for combining 
software with its dependencies into a standardised structure known as a container.
The following are some essential Docker points:
• Containerization: Docker makes it possible to isolate apps and the dependencies they 
require into discrete, self-contained entities known as containers. Regardless of the 
underlying architecture, containers can run on any system that has Docker installed 
and are small and lightweight.
• Docker containers are extremely portable. On your local development workstation, a 
container can be created and operate in a variety of contexts, including test servers, 
other development machines, and even the cloud. Regardless of the host system, 
containers ensure consistent behaviour by encapsulating the entire runtime 
environment.
• Efficiency: Docker containers are lighter than virtual machines (VMs) since they share 
the kernel of the host operating system. This sharing enables larger density of 
containerized apps on a single host, more effective resource utilisation, and quicker 
startup times.
• Isolation: Docker gives containers isolation at the process level. Each container has its 
own process namespace, filesystem, and network interfaces. By preventing 
interference between programmes running in different containers, this isolation 
creates a stable and secure environment.
• Versioning and reproducibility are made possible via Docker, which enables you to 
define the whole application stack in a file known as a Dockerfile. The instructions in 
this file describe how to create an image that may be used as a template when 
making containers. You can quickly recreate the same environment by versioning and 
distributing Docker files.
• Scalability: By enabling container replication across several hosts, Docker makes it 
easier to scale applications. You may manage container clusters, distribute the 
workload, and scale up or down in response to demand using Docker's orchestration 
tools, like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
• Collaboration and Ecosystem: Docker has a sizable and vibrant community that offers 
a vast ecosystem of pre-built tools and images. Container images can be shared and 
found by visiting the Docker Hub and Docker Store. The ability to package and 
distribute apps as containers facilitates collaboration.
